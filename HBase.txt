HBase
- Open source, distributed database, developed by Apache...
- Written on Java
- can store data from terabytes to petabytes

Unique Features:
- Built for low latency operations...
- Stores large amount of data in terms of table

Hbase is column-oriented database and data is stored in tables.
Tables are sorted by RowId

KeyTerms:
- Table      		 => Collection of rows present
- Row  			 => Collection of column families
- Column Family	 => Collection of column
- Column		 => Collection of key:value pairs
- Namespace		 => Logical grouping of tables
- Cell			 => A tuple exactly specifies a cell definition in HBase

Column-oriented Database 
=>Online Analytical Processing
=> the amount of data that can able to store in this model is very huge like in petabytes
Row-oriented Database	 
=> Online Transactional Process
=> small number of rows and columns




What HBase Consist of..?
- Set of tables.
- Each table with column families.
- Each table must have an elements as Primary Key.
- Row acts as a Primary Key in HBase.
- Any access to HBase tables uses this Primary Key
- Each column present in HBase denotes attribute corresponding to object



Major Components of HBase:
- HMaster
- HRegionserver
- HRegions
- Zookeeper

HMaster Role:
- plays imp role in terms of performance and maintaining nodes in cluster
- assigns regions to region servers
- When a client wants to change a schema and to change metadata operations, HMaster takes responibility

Methods exposed by HMaster:
Table => create, remove, enable, disable
ColumnFamily => add, modify
Region => move, assign

HRegionServers:
- Hosting and managing regions
- Splitting regions automatically
- Handling read and write requests
- Communicating with the client directly


HRegions:
Basic Building elements of HBase cluster that consists of the distribution of tables an comprised of
column families.
It has two major components -: MemStore and HFile

MemStore :
- Memstore for each store for each region for the table
- it sorts data before flusing into HFiles
- Write and read performance will increase because of sorting

ZooKeeper
- if the client wants to communicate with regions, the server client has to approach zookeeper first.


Services Provided by Zookeeper
- Maintains configuration info.
- Provided distributed synch.
- Client Communication establishment with region servers
- To track server failure and network partitions
